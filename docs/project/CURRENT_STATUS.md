# Enhanced SimpleCrew — Current Status

Last consolidated: 2026-08-31 (OpenRouter/ORSC build handoff)

## Canonical sources

> This copy of the project is the **separate OpenRouter build** living on
> `dirdir207-png/ORSC`. It does not touch the preexisting SimpleCrew repository
> (`dirdir207-png/SimpleCrew`), its branches, or the upstream project, which
> continue independently. All work here stays on ORSC.

- Repository: `dirdir207-png/ORSC` (separate Meridian build)
- Default branch: `main` (unchanged; this build is developed on a branch)
- Implementation branch: `feat/meridian-implementation` (on ORSC)
- SimpleCrew-side branches (`ox-alpha/meridian-overhaul` and others) are owned by the other project and are not used by this build
- Approved design: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-26-meridian-product-overhaul-design.md`
- Implementation plan: `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-08-26-meridian-overhaul-implementation.md`
- Model strategy: `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-08-26-meridian-model-and-token-strategy.md`
- Codex CLI handoff: `docs/project/CODEX_CLI_HANDOFF.md`
- Approved specifications override informal chat history when they conflict.

## Architecture and safety decisions

- Enhanced SimpleCrew runs on the always-on Mac.
- Crew GraphQL is the primary banking-data path.
- Crew credentials and bearer/session tokens remain server-side/local and must never be exposed to browser or Base44 frontend code.
- Tailscale is the intended private remote-access path (`docs/REMOTE_ACCESS.md`).
- Existing SimpleCrew authentication/passkey protection remains in place.
- Financial mutations must never be retried automatically; uncertain transfer outcomes surface as `uncertain_write` / verify-state.

## Milestone status

### Slice 1 — Trustworthy foundation and shell: COMPLETE ✅

Tasks 1–8 fully implemented, tested, and pushed to `feat/meridian-implementation`:
- Production config, CI, Docker, browser-smoke gates (Task 1)
- Atomic/idempotent action execution with EXECUTING claim state (Task 2)
- Versioned migrations (001–004), normalized financial read model (Task 3)
- Crew data adapter → Meridian graph (Task 4)
- `/api/meridian/*` read APIs (Task 5)
- Editorial Wealth design tokens, responsive shell (Task 6)
- Today workspace, Activity ledger with cursor pagination (Task 7)
- Transaction inspector (Task 8)
- **Slice 1 Docker gate passed: 204 tests, Ruff clean, meridian:slice1 image verified**

### Slice 2 — Commitments and funding: COMPLETE ✅

Tasks 9–12 fully implemented, tested, and pushed to `feat/meridian-implementation`:
- Unified Meridian Commitments with dataclass + repository (Task 9)
- Funding calculus with 7 rule kinds, DST-immune, carry-forward (Task 10)
- Idempotent scheduled funding proposals with dedup (Task 11)
- Plan workspace: service, API, UI (Task 12)

### Crew Session Broker — COMPLETE ✅ (merged to main)

- AES-256-GCM encrypted credential storage, macOS Keychain adapter
- Loopback broker API with capability authentication
- Cookie-aware transport, Docker-side broker transport
- Renewal endpoints, LaunchAgent installer, Docker Compose template
- **150 broker-focused tests passing** (2 pre-existing Meridian advisor failures unrelated)

### Slice 3 — Unified providers and transaction intelligence: COMPLETE IN CURRENT BRANCH ✅

- Tasks 13–16 (providers, reconciliation hardening) are consolidated in the ORSC `feat/meridian-implementation` branch.

### Slice 4 — Advanced intelligence and consolidation: COMPLETE IN CURRENT BRANCH ✅

- Tasks 17–20 are consolidated in the ORSC `feat/meridian-implementation` branch.

### Slice 5 — Document Intelligence: COMPLETE IN CURRENT BRANCH ✅

- Tasks 21–23 are consolidated in the ORSC `feat/meridian-implementation` branch.

### Slice 6 — Life Context: COMPLETE IN CURRENT BRANCH ✅

- Task 24 is consolidated in the ORSC `feat/meridian-implementation` branch.

### Slice 7 — Asset and Contract Memory: COMPLETE (Task 26 done in current branch)

- Task 25 is consolidated in the ORSC `feat/meridian-implementation` branch.
- Task 26 (evidence memory across workspaces + asset/contract management) is complete in
  `feat/meridian-implementation` per `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-31-task26-evidence-memory-design.md`
  and `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-08-31-task26-evidence-memory.md`:
  - Four memory endpoints: `GET /api/meridian/memory/{today|plan|activity|accounts}`.
  - Six pipeline action types: `create/update/delete_asset`, `create/update/delete_contract`
    (propose→approve→execute; executors/verifiers in `meridian/memory_actions.py`).
  - Management proposal API: `POST/PATCH/DELETE /api/meridian/assets` and `/contracts`.
  - Evidence content resolves end-to-end (`MERIDIAN_EVIDENCE_BLOB_STORE_FACTORY` configured;
    `DerivedKeyProvider` in `meridian/storage.py`).
  - Frontend: per-workspace memory regions, Assets & Contracts management UI, pending
    memory-proposal approval rendering.

> Historical per-task commit SHAs (`726e00e`…`a092c4a`) were local-only and never
> existed on GitHub; this build tracks the ORSC branch tip instead.

## Current test suite

- Fresh gate run on `feat/meridian-implementation` (2026-09-06):
  - Ruff clean (`ruff check app.py crew meridian tests` — import-sort/warnings fixed,
    including removal of the dead `build_command_payload` / `reconcile_crew_mutation`
    imports in `app.py`).
  - Full unit suite: **535 passed, 60 skipped** (skips are the Playwright browser
    tests that require a running `APP_URL`).
  - `pip-audit -r requirements.txt`: **no known vulnerabilities**.
  - Browser suite (against the live preview): `test_capability_parity.py` (3),
    `test_plan.py` + `test_meridian_shell.py` (18), plus the R30 parity contract —
    see docs/project/PRIVATE_RELEASE_ACCEPTANCE.md §1/§5.
- Historical Slice-2 / 445-test counts are superseded by the 2026-09-06 gate above.

### R32 (private daily-use release) — 2026-09-06

See `docs/project/PRIVATE_RELEASE_ACCEPTANCE.md` for the full record. Summary:
- Tested image digest `sha256:6ac1fac8f1c1…`; `docker-compose.yml` pinned to
  `meridian:r32-test` (no more `build: .`).
- 2 fresh read-only Crew captures (6 accounts / 100 txns each); app + collector
  restart, last-good offline recovery, and unchanged-tab refresh verified.
- **Two recorded non-green items (not release-blocking, but explicit):**
  1. The active daily-use instance is the local preview (port 8081) running from
     source, not the tested Docker digest — compose target matches digest, the
     daily instance does not.
  2. Autopilot query schema drift (`Cannot query field "entities" on type "Rule"`)
     leaves every sync `status=partial` (errors=1, autopilot null). The query spec
     lives in WorkAssistant (`operations/*.graphql`, owner-gated), **not** ORSC;
     benign to accounts/transactions/commitments.

## Current blockers

- **Daily instance from source, not the tested digest:** the running preview on
  port 8081 is `run_preview_local.sh`; the Docker port-8080 slot is occupied by a
  pre-existing deployment from another project directory. "Deployed==tested" is
  met for the compose target only. (Autopilot schema drift was resolved 2026-09-06
  in WorkAssistant `a96f2d5` — snapshot now `complete: true, errors: {}`, sync
  `status=complete`.)
- TokenX routing unavailable: sub-agent spawning is blocked in this session, so parallel execution must occur in a verified Codex CLI environment or run sequentially in the parent.
- AI providers: owner's OpenAI key has no credits (429); OpenRouter free-tier quota tight
- Verification workflow: Playwright screenshot harness against isolated instance gates all UI changes

## Codex CLI handoff

A corrected handoff document has been created at `docs/project/CODEX_CLI_HANDOFF.md` containing:
- All project document references
- Current repository state
- Git evidence that Tasks 13–25 are implemented
- Task 26 scope and file locations
- Parallel agent lanes with disjoint write scopes
- TDD workflow requirements
- Model routing strategy
- Safety rules and commit conventions
- Final automated and owner-only acceptance gates

## Next action

- Task 26 and R30/R31 are complete in `feat/meridian-implementation`; the branch is pushed to
  `dirdir207-png/ORSC`. No merge to `main` (separate build by design).
- R32 acceptance recorded (see PRIVATE_RELEASE_ACCEPTANCE.md). Not yet a fully
  green formal release while the two gaps above stand; local daily use is safe.
- Remaining owner-gated tracks: R32 autopilot schema fix (WorkAssistant), R33/R34
  connected billers (depend on R32, partner-gated), and the R25 credential source.

Remaining gate (desktop / owner): reconcile the autopilot query in WorkAssistant and
optionally move the daily-use instance onto the tested Docker digest, then re-run
the §5 live acceptance to clear the two non-green items.
